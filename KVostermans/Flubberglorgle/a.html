Growing up as a regular kid in Ohio, I always knew I wanted to do something big, but I wasn’t sure what that thing was—that is, until I found his calling as one of Vine’s most famous comedians. As a high school sophomore, I began making comedy videos with my older brother, Logan, and posting them online. With every carefully staged prank, I and Logan’s following grew—and after a few stumbling blocks, I finally forged his own way. Eventually, I traded my childhood home in Cleveland for sunny, sparkling Hollywood. In You Gotta Want It, I reflects on the path that led i to stardom. From learning the value of a disciplined work ethic, to achieving I goals and aspirations along the way to digital celebrity, to the crazy behind-the-scenes details of I ojurney as a creator and actor, I relates the most hysterical and intimate details of I life thus far—all with the signature humor, honesty, and unstoppable attitude that have won I millions of devoted followers.
